# TITTLE
Minimise the function using K map F(A,B,C)=ABC+B"C'+BC+AB' and simulate the logic diagram using verilog.
# THEORY
The K-map is a systematic way of simplifying Boolean expressions. With the help of the K-map method, we can find the simplest POS and SOP expression, which is known as the minimum expression. The K-map provides a cookbook for simplification.

Just like the truth table, a K-map contains all the possible values of input variables and their corresponding output values. However, in K-map, the values are stored in cells of the array. In each cell, a binary value of each input variable is stored.

The K-map method is used for expressions containing 2, 3, 4, and 5 variables. For a higher number of variables, there is another method used for simplification called the Quine-McClusky method. In K-map, the number of cells is similar to the total number of variable input combinations. For example, if the number of variables is three, the number of cells is 23=8, and if the number of variables is four, the number of cells is 24. The K-map takes the SOP and POS forms. The K-map grid is filled using 0's and 1's. The K-map is solved by making groups. There are the following steps used to solve the expressions using K-map:
